\usage{
select(sEnv = NULL, nSelect = 40, popID = NULL, random = F,
  type = "Mass")
}
\arguments{
\item{sEnv}{the environment that BSL functions operate in. If NULL, the default \code{simEnv} is attempted}

\item{nSelect}{the number of selected individuals (default: 40)}

\item{popID}{population ID to be selected (default: When random=T, the last population. When random=F, it is the last evaluated population)}

\item{random}{assuming random selection or selection according to estimated value (T: random selection, F: selection for high value)}

\item{type}{"WithinFamily" or "Mass" (default: Mass). If Mass, all individuals are ranked against each other and the highest nSelect are taken.  If WithinFamily, individuals are ranked within paternal half-sib (if population was randomly mated) or full-sib (if population from selfFertilize or doubledHaploid) families. If random=T, then selection within families is random.}
}
\value{
modifies the list sims in environment sEnv by selecting individuals of the specified popID with the default selection criterion and giving those individuals a new popID
