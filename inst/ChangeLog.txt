21 Oct 2018
Small bug fix to `select` if you are trying to select more individuals than there are in the population.  Added a vignette on `testParamterOptimality`.

20 Oct 2018
Small bug fix to `plotData`.  Added vignette on within-family selection.

19 Oct 2018
Changes to NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION so snowfall and Rcpp will load properly.

30 Sept 2018
Added a function `testParameterOptimality` that takes a simulation environment, a path to a breeding scheme script, an objective function, and a budget.  It returns the objective for the scheme in the environment, unless the scheme goes over budget in which case it returns the budget but NA for the objective.

16 August 2018
Removed the `parts` parameter from all functions: it was not useful.

21 July 2018
Modifications to many functions so that the budget of a breeding scheme can be calculated without actually running the scheme.

20 June 2018
defineSpecies now sets the number of markers according to the number of loci loaded.  Output results now returns an object in addition to saving a file.

Bug fix if you had founder haplotypes with no QTL information

Change to genome.cpp to correct a memory allocation error

25 Apr 2018
Change to getCoalescentSim so that it uses an R session designated temporary file

20 Apr 2018
Bug fix to select() when random=T so that within-family selection is also random.
Behavior fix to cross(), selfFertilize(), and doubledHaploid() so that the newly created population is the target for a subsequent select() if random=T.
